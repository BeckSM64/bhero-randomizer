# This RAM Address writes to level complete address

# ROM Address counterpart
0005CC38

# If this the assembly instruction at the ROM address is NOP, that should prevent marking the level as having been complete.
# This will solve the problem where when randomizing levels, once an area has been completed, the next level will not be selected,
# but instead the area in which that level resides. Once the area is selected, the first level will be selected by default, regardless
# of the next level in the autogenerated sequence. By NOPing the address that marks levels as complete, no area will be considered actually
# complete. Which will resolve this issue. This is a temporary solution as this is kind of hacky, and will prevent the player from being
# able to exit areas and reenter, as it will force them to then play the first level in the area instead of the next one in the randomized
# sequence. This is fine for now, but does mean players need to play the entire game in one sitting, which is fine for now as this is mainly
# a hack intended for meembers of the Bomberman Hero Speedrunning community.
